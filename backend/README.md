# bze-scan backend

Go module `github.com/bze-alphateam/bze-scan/backend`, Go 1.26 (the floor is set
by the `bze` chain module it imports to decode message types).

One binary, `bze-scan`, with subcommands:

- `serve` — the production process: the read-only HTTP API with its raw-JSON
  proxy (archive responses cached in memory) and its status endpoint, the
  live indexer (woken by a PostgreSQL notification at each block the node's
  `psql` indexer commits, with a height cursor as the guarantee), the state
  sync (driven by what the indexer sees, with tickers as a safety net) and,
  when enabled by configuration, the backfill. One process, one log.
- `migrate` — applies the versioned migrations: the explorer schema, its
  partitions, the one notification trigger on the CometBFT `psql` indexer's
  `blocks` table, and the classification seed tables. The indexer's own tables
  are never altered otherwise.
- `backfill` — walks history backwards from archive nodes through a pool of
  workers and one batching writer, at a polite rate, normalising old event
  formats. Checkpointed and resumable; never writes the node's indexer tables.
- `reindex` — re-runs a list of heights or a range through the same pipeline,
  from the local node while it still has them and from archive nodes otherwise.
- `sync-state` — one full refresh of validators, proposals, denominations,
  holders, labels, the Cosmos chain registry cache and token prices, for
  operations.

Every node call is by height (`/block`, `/block_results`, `/commit`, `/status`
and gRPC state queries); the search routes are never used, on any node.

The raw-JSON routes serve a block, its results, its commit and a transaction
(sliced from its block by index) from an in-memory cache that the live indexer
fills at index time and that is filled from the archive nodes on a miss. The
local node is never asked for them, and nothing raw is written to the database.

The status endpoint returns a snapshot that a checker refreshes once a minute,
so a request never touches a node or the database. `live_fill` is healthy when
the last indexed height moved since the previous check and is within 5 heights
of both the local node and an archive node; it carries the three heights.
`back_fill` says whether the backfill is finished or in progress and the
oldest indexed height. The response is HTTP 200 whenever the process serves;
the JSON carries the verdict, so a halted chain never blocks a deploy.
